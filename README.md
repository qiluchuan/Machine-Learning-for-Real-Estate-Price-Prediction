# Machine-Learning-for-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project is to replicate and extend the findings from the article “The Use of Machine Learning in Real Estate Research” by implementing various machine learning and deep learning models. The machine learning techniques Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are performed
